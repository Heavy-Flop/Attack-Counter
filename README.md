Plugin that counts various helpful player combat metrics for tracking, including:

1. Attempted Attacks [Any attempted attack on an enemy]
2. Successful Attacks [Any attacks that successfully dealt damage to an enemy]
3. Damage Dealt [Any damage dealt to enemies]

Additionally, thresholds can be set at which these values will reset and measurements will begin anew (i.e., reset when attempted attacks reach 10 and/or damage dealt reaches 30)
